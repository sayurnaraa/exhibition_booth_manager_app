Section A: Application Development (50%) 
1. Project Overview 
Create a comprehensive Android platform with Flutter  for managing trade shows and 
exhibitions. This system facilitates the entire lifecycle, from Exhibition Organizers creating events and 
managing floor plans, to Exhibitors discovering events, selecting and booking specific booths on a map, 
and managing the ir participation. This project emphasizes spatial booking (booth selection via a 
visual map) and multi-role interactions (besides administrators, also Organizer vs. Exhibitor). 
 
2. Requirements for Pages & Features 
 
(1) Guest Page:  
⚫ Browse a list of published exhibition events. Each event card shows status (e.g., 
Upcoming, Ongoing), , accessible to unauthenticated users (without logging in). 
⚫ View exhibition details, including a read-only visual floor plan/map showing booth layout 
and general information (e.g., "Booth A -12: Premium, 20sqm, $1500") , accessible to 
unauthenticated users (without logging in). 
⚫ Guide users to register/login to make a booking. 
 
(2) Registration/Login Pages:  
 Organizers, exhibitors and administrators must have separate login endpoints or a unified one 
that can distinguish between these roles. 
 
(3) Exhibitor Page (Post-Registration/Login): 
Booth Discovery, Selection & Application Flow (Core):   
1) Event Selection: Choose from a list of published exhibitions. 
2) Interactive Floor Plan: A central feature. Exhibitors view a detailed, interactive floor map 
of the exhibition. Booths are color -coded (e.g., Green=Available, Red=Booked, 
Blue=Selected-by-me). 
3) Booth Selection: Exhibitors can tap on an available booth on the map to view its details 
(size, price, amenities like power, wifi) and add it to their selection cart. The system should 
prevent selection of adjacent booths by competitors (a configurable rule by the organizer). 
4) Booth Application Form: After selecting booths from the map, exhibitors fill out an 
application form. This is not just a booking, but an application that requires providing: 
⚫ Company Name & Description 
⚫ Exhibit Profile/Description (what they plan to showcase) 
⚫ event_startdate and event_enddate (the exhibition duration is fixed, these are for record). 
⚫ Selection of additems (e.g., additional furniture, promotional spots, extended wifi). 
5) Application Submission: Submits the application for organizer approval. The status 
becomes "Pending Review". Receive notice after organizer's decision.  If rejected or 
cancelled, could re-start application from Step. 1. 
 
Booking/Application Management (Core):  
⚫ View: "My Applications" screen lists all booth applications with statuses (Pending, 
Approved, Rejected). 
⚫ Update: Can modify application details (e.g., exhibit description, add -ons) only while 
status is "Pending". 
⚫ Delete: Users can cancel upcoming bookings with a confirmation dialog. 
 
(4) Organizer Page (Core, Post-Login): 

--- PAGE BREAK ---

3 
 
⚫ Exhibition Management: Full CRUD for their own exhibition events.  
⚫ Booth Management: For their own exhibitions, create booth types, set prices, and manage 
availability. 
⚫ Approve/Reject/Cancel: Can approve, reject or withdraw the application ("Pending") , or 
cancel a booking ("Approved"") subject to self-defined rules. Rejection and cancellation 
should be with reasons. 
 
(5) Administrator Page (Core, Post-Login): 
⚫ Floor Plan Management: Upload/Manage floor plan images and digitally map booths (e.g., 
define booth IDs, types, coordinates, and attributes on the image). 
⚫ Exhibition Management: Full CRUD for all exhibition events. Key field: is_published 
(boolean) to control visibility to organizers and exhibitors. 
⚫ Booth Management: Create booth types, set prices, and manage availability  from the 
system level. 
⚫ Manage user accounts. 
⚫ View and manage all exhibitor reservations. (View, Edit, Cancel any booking  with 
appropriate processes). 
 
3. Core Technical Requirement: 
(1) Must provide basic search / filter functions; Features like payment, notice, and characteristics like 
security, robustness, high performance, user friendliness will bring extra points. 
(2) Must use no fewer than 3 third-party packages. These can cover areas such as: 
⚫ Routing (e.g., go_router) 
⚫ Network (e.g., http, dio) 
⚫ Caching (e.g., hive, shared_preferences) 
⚫ State Management (e.g., riverpod, flutter_bloc) 
⚫ Security (e.g., flutter_secure_storage) 
⚫ UI (e.g., flutter_svg, cached_network_image) 
(3) Must use at least 1 database product, Firebase/MySQL/SQLite. Create a database named 
exhibition_booth_management which has tables in accord with your app requirement. List all the 
logic tables in your report, including fields, data type, data length, primary key/foreign key, etc (some 
only for relational databases). 
 
Section B: Project Report (30%) 
 The project report should consist of the following components: 
1. Cover page 
2. Requirement Analysis 
3. Adopted Software Life Cycle Model (e.g., Agile, Waterfall) 
4. Module Division/Breakdown

6. Step-by-step User Guide with Screenshots 
7. Repository Link 
8. Plagiarism Statement with all members' signatures, Individual Task Breakdown &

9. References (Minimum 5, formatted in APA style) 
 
Section C: Project Presentation (20%) 
1. Presentation must be carried out by ALL members of the group highlighting the main 
points of their project (Codes and Database).
